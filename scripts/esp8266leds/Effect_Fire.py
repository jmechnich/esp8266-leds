# This basic one-dimensional 'fire' simulation works roughly as follows:
# There's a underlying array of 'heat' cells, that model the temperature
# at each point along the line.  Every cycle through the simulation, 
# four steps are performed:
#  1) All cells cool down a little bit, losing heat to the air
#  2) The heat from each cell drifts 'up' and diffuses a little
#  3) Sometimes randomly new 'sparks' of heat are added at the bottom
#  4) The heat from each cell is rendered as a color into the leds array
#     The heat-to-color mapping uses a black-body radiation approximation.

# Temperature is in arbitrary units from 0 (cold black) to 255 (white hot).

# This simulation scales it self a bit depending on NUM_LEDS; it should look
# "OK" on anywhere from 20 to 100 LEDs without too much tweaking. 

# I recommend running this simulation at anywhere from 30-100 frames per second,
# meaning an interframe delay of about 10-35 milliseconds.

# There are two main parameters you can play with to control the look and
# feel of your fire: COOLING and SPARKING.

# COOLING: How much does the air cool as it rises?
# Less cooling = taller flames.  More cooling = shorter flames.
# Default 55, suggested range 20-100 

# SPARKING: What chance (out of 255) is there that a new spark will be lit?
# Higher chance = more roaring fire.  Lower chance = more flickery fire.
# Default 120, suggested range 50-200.
